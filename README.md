# README for Bioimage Analysis Scripts Repository

## Overview
This repository hosts a collection of Python scripts designed for bioimage analysis, particularly focusing on stability and quality assessment in tissue imaging. The scripts are suitable for researchers and professionals in bioinformatics, pathology, and related fields who require automated, efficient analysis of tissue images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: SciPy, PySimpleGUI, pandas, re, NumPy, skimage, OpenCV (cv2), pathlib, tifffile, seaborn, matplotlib, xlsxwriter, imutils, etc.
- Tissue image files in formats like .tif for processing and analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
3. Install required Python libraries:
   ```
   pip install scipy PySimpleGUI pandas numpy scikit-image opencv-python-headless pathlib tifffile seaborn matplotlib xlsxwriter imutils
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the script folder of interest.
3. Run the script using Python and provide necessary inputs, such as image files or analysis parameters.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. You can contribute in several ways:

- Adding new scripts for bioimage analysis.
- Enhancing existing scripts with new features or improvements.
- Reporting bugs and suggesting fixes.
- Providing or improving documentation.

Please follow standard coding practices and ensure that any new contributions are well-documented and tested.

## Disclaimer

These scripts are provided for research and educational purposes. Users should verify the suitability of the scripts for their specific tasks and datasets. The authors of the scripts are not responsible for any misuse or incorrect interpretations of the results.


## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to all contributors who have developed and refined these scripts, making them valuable tools for the bioimage analysis community.
